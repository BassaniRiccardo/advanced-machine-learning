# project_python_advanced_machine_learning

Date: Jan 2020

This project contains the work done in the course "Advanced Machine Learning", at Utrecht University.
It is made of three assignments in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.
The first two focus on Causal Inference, and on the implementation of the PC Algorithm.
The third consist in training an agent in an episodic task, using semi-gradient_n-step_Q-learning with a linear value function.
